CMPS 128 Homework 3
Use Ctrl + C to stop server

Very rarely test_m fails (once or twice in a few dozen tests)
- Not 100% why but it may have to do with my changing the sleep times to lower numbers or replica gossip service accidentally scheduling the same target back to back.

There is a bug with test_n - for some reason it occasionally tries to kill a node that was already killed and you expect the number_of_nodes to be lower when it can't be. Could not figure out how to correct this issue. If the bug does not occur (happens randomly) the test passes successfully.

Thank You for all your time TAs :)
